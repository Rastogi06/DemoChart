# CorporateCafe

##Problem

As per WHO advisory, we need to practice Social distancing to flatten the curve and keep safe from COVID-19.
Each firm/institution need to reassess, reengineer aand reimagine their workplace.We can arrange work-desks at a distance to follow social distancing but what about the cafeteria's or public places where managing distancing is really difficult as we can't compromise employees time and productivity as well as their health and well being.

##Idea

The 'new normal' way to the office cafeteria.
Efficiently planning social distancing at cafeteria using a web application which will help find the current occupancy of the cafeteria before leaving our desks.
This will uphold social distancing by avoiding crowds and help us with live status to avoid hassles of going to the cafeteria to see if it's full/available.

##Technology

Using web application, employees need to register themselves to get in the cafeteria.
Login into the web application once entering the cafeteria and logout while exiting.The Admin can keep the track of the people in the cafeteria and can define the 
maximum limit inside the cafeteria based on its size and resource availablity. Users can view the dashboard at a time and can plan accordingly in a group or as an individual to go inside cafeteria.
